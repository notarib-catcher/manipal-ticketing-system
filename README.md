# MPTICKET-CLIENT

Meant to be a client for the `notarib-catcher/MPTICKET` repository. Requires an MPTICKET server instance to run.

## Build instructions

Follow the default capacitor+svelte build rules.
Requires node.js and android studio to build.
Currently only works on android (Web is never coming, I don't have a mac and can't port to iOS)
